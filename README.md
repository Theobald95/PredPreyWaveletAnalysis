# PredPreyWaveletAnalysis
The goal of this code is to provide reliable surrogate data testing for time series. 
Three different methods to generate surrogate data are presented with different null hypotheses.
H0 scrambling method: The observed data is a realisation of independently and identically
distributed random variables (white noise).
H0 AAFT method: The observed data is a realisation of an underlying stationary linear
Gaussian process measured by an invertible time-independent instantaneous measurement function.
H0 IAAFT_td method: The observed data is a realisation of an underlying linear Gaussian
process with possibly a deterministic trend and slowly changing parameters.
