Caption of the figures:  
a. Measurement prey (M. minutum, blue), predators (B. calyciflorus, red),  
b. Trajectory in phase space,  
c. Wavelet coherence of prey and predators: Areas with significant wavelet coherence (surrounded by a thin black line), coherent regimes (thick black line) inside the dominating frequencies (two constant black lines),  
d. Logarithmic timeaveraged wavelet cross-spectrum of predators and prey,  
e. 95%-quantile of the surrogates wavelet coherence,  
f. Phase histogram during coherent regimes between prey and predators (blue), eggs (yellow), egg-ratio (orange) and dead (violet).
